Learn Poshi
======================

Welcome to Liferay's Poshi training course. What is Poshi? And why do we use it at Liferay? These and other questions will be answered as you go through this course.

Poshi is a tool developed at Liferay that allows test writers to write and automate tests that simulate a real userâ€™s behavior. As we move on through this course, we will learn more about the tools and functionality of Poshi.
